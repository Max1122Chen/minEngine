# minEngine Progress Log (for AI)

Last updated: 2026-04-16

## Purpose

This file is an AI-oriented progress digest converted from commit messages.
It is not a full changelog. It focuses on architecture moves, rendering milestones, and known pitfalls.

## Timeline Summary

1. Initial framework stage
- Set up basic engine framework and RenderSystem foundations.
- Built simple mesh/texture support and early input handling.

2. Scene and component architecture stage
- Introduced GameObject/Component model, Level/WorldManager, Transform.
- Added render-side abstraction using SceneProxy.
- Started AssetManager and resource-oriented structure.

3. Lighting and model import stage
- Added light components and light scene proxies.
- Extended Phong shader for directional/point/spot lights.
- Added basic model import via Assimp.

4. Rendering pipeline structuring stage
- Reorganized render files (RHI, light proxies, primitive proxies).
- Added translucency pass.
- Added present pass for offscreen-to-screen output.

5. Data upload optimization stage
- Added per-frame camera UniformBuffer.
- Added separate light UBO.
- Reduced redundant light data upload frequency.

6. Shadow and stability stage (recent)
- Added directional light shadow pass and shadow map sampling.
- Fixed repeated queue growth issue (missing clear each frame).
- Fixed Texture2D release issue causing GPU memory leak.
- Fixed light proxy write-back issue causing repeated creation/leak risk.

7. Reflection modernization stage (2026-04-10 ~ 2026-04-12)
- Introduced MEReflection in parallel with legacy reflection for migration.
- Refactored reflection/serialization boundaries and startup finalization flow.
- Added better reflection finalization error logging and repaired GameObject reflection path.

8. Serialization capability expansion stage (2026-04-12 ~ 2026-04-14)
- Implemented pointer deserialization foundation in Serializer.
- Added primitive codec registry and MEEnum codec support.
- Unblocked GameObject serialization for owned inline component arrays (shared_ptr<Component>).
- Reenabled Inspector path for GameObject and component fields.

9. Asset identity and registry kickoff stage (WIP, 2026-04-16)
- Started GUID type and generation utility for asset identity.
- Introduced AssetMeta and initial in-memory asset registry shape.
- Added AssetManager scan/register flow and Texture2DResource reflection stub.

## Current Technical Focus (Inferred)

- Complete reflection/serialization migration without breaking editor workflows.
- Finalize pointer/reference semantics for MEObject relationships.
- Build asset metadata persistence (.meta read/write) and GUID lifecycle stability.
- Keep scene serialization, inspector, and resource loading behavior aligned.

## Known Pitfalls to Recheck During Refactors

- Any per-frame vector/list/map used in pipeline build path must be cleared or reused safely.
- Any GL resource wrapper must own and release native handles in destructor.
- Scene proxies or render entries must not be recreated indefinitely without ownership policy.
- Shadow pass changes (viewport/state/targets) must be restored before later passes.
- Pointer deserialization must clearly separate ownership and reference semantics.
- Serializer signature changes must be synchronized across all callsites.
- Asset scanning must avoid duplicate registration and accidental GUID regeneration.

## Entry Template (Append for each meaningful task)

### YYYY-MM-DD - Task title
- Goal:
- Main changes:
- Risks or caveats:
- Validation done:
- Next step:

### 2026-03-26 - Playground player control enhancement
- Goal:
	Add vertical flight and improve camera control experience in Playground.
- Main changes:
	Added IA_UpAndDown for E/Q vertical movement.
	Added IA_Look camera rotation logic with pitch clamp and sensitivity.
	Added wheel input support path via WindowSystem/GLFWWindowSystem/InputSystem and mapped MouseScroll in Playground.
	Fixed horizontal look direction sign to match expected user control direction.
- Risks or caveats:
	Mouse2D and MouseScroll semantics are still evolving between engine-side abstraction and gameplay-side handling.
	Future refactor may separate event-like input and state-like input more clearly.
- Validation done:
	CMake build completed successfully after control/input changes.
	Manual interaction checks performed in Playground for movement and look direction.
- Next step:
	Standardize mouse delta semantics at one layer only (engine or gameplay) to avoid double-delta bugs.

### 2026-04-06 - Scene serialization MVP pipeline wiring
- Goal:
	Wire a minimal end-to-end scene save/load loop for editor usage.
- Main changes:
	Added SceneSerializer with JSON save/load for scene name and game object transform list.
	Extended Scene object creation to support explicit object IDs for deterministic reload.
	Implemented SceneManager::CreateNewScene/LoadScene and default scene path resolution.
	Wired Editor File menu actions (New/Open/Save/Exit) to SceneManager and SceneSerializer.
	Created default editor scene on startup for immediate save/load testing.
- Risks or caveats:
	Current MVP only serializes scene name, object id, and transform; component graph is not serialized yet.
	Open Scene currently uses a fixed default path and has no file dialog.
- Validation done:
	File-level diagnostics passed for all touched scene/editor source files.
- Next step:
	Add component type registry and polymorphic component serialization/deserialization.

### 2026-04-10 - MEReflection parallel migration start
- Goal:
	Introduce a safer migration path by running new reflection flow in parallel with legacy reflection.
- Main changes:
	Added MEReflection alongside legacy reflection system.
	Prepared architecture boundaries for incremental migration instead of one-shot replacement.
- Risks or caveats:
	Dual-stack reflection can drift if registration/finalization behavior diverges.
- Validation done:
	Integrated into branch history and enabled follow-up serializer/reflection work.
- Next step:
	Consolidate registration/finalization ownership and remove duplicate paths gradually.

### 2026-04-12 - Reflection finalization reliability and GameObject fix
- Goal:
	Restore reflection correctness and unblock dependent serialization/editor features.
- Main changes:
	Added reflection finalization into engine startup flow.
	Added reflection finalization error logs to surface missing registration issues.
	Fixed GameObject-related reflection path issues and generated required reflection artifacts.
- Risks or caveats:
	Generated code order and startup timing still require strict consistency.
- Validation done:
	Reflection path recovered enough to continue pointer/serializer feature work.
- Next step:
	Continue serializer refactor with stronger pointer handling and field coverage.

### 2026-04-14 - Serializer pointer path, enum codec, inspector recovery
- Goal:
	Expand serialization coverage to component graphs and reconnect editor inspection flow.
- Main changes:
	Implemented pointer deserialization baseline in Serializer.
	Added primitive codec registry with MEEnum support.
	Successfully serialized a GameObject containing owned inline shared_ptr<Component> arrays.
	Reenabled Inspector for GameObject and component fields.
- Risks or caveats:
	Non-owned shared_ptr<MEObject> reference serialization is not finished.
	Pointer ownership/memory behavior still needs hardening in edge cases.
- Validation done:
	Commit notes confirm end-to-end success for owned component array scenario.
- Next step:
	Implement reference-mode object identity path and resolve semantics for external object references.

### 2026-04-16 - Asset metadata and GUID foundation (WIP)
- Goal:
	Prepare asset identity and registry infrastructure for future asset database workflow.
- Main changes:
	Added GUID type and GenerateGUID utility.
	Introduced AssetMeta (path/type/guid) and AssetManager in-memory registry map.
	Added AssetManager::ScanAssets and RegisterAsset initial flow.
	Added Texture2DResource and generated reflection header for resource-level metadata serialization prep.
	Refactored editor default-scene population helper and aligned serializer callsites with updated parameter flow.
- Risks or caveats:
	.meta persistence is still TODO; GUID reuse/load policy is not finalized.
	Current workspace includes uncommitted WIP changes and may still need integration fixes.
- Validation done:
	Local scope and file topology are in place; full fresh build validation has not been recorded yet for this WIP batch.
- Next step:
	Implement meta read/write + GUID reuse strategy, then run full build and editor open/save smoke test.
